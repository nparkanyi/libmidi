Stuff to fix:
-------------

* actually parse the time_div in the header to properly handle tempos
* implement SMPTE offset meta event
* in some places, FILE_IO_ERROR where maybe FILE_INVALID is more appropriate?
* processing meta events should get its own function
* http://www.somascape.org/midi/tech/mfile.html is a nice reference
