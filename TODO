Stuff to fix:
-------------

* when reading in MIDI channel events, we're always reading two bytes,
  but some event types only have one (explains the track reading problems?)
* in some places, FILE_IO_ERROR where maybe FILE_INVALID is more appropriate?
* processing meta events should get its own function
